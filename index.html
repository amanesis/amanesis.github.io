      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Manesis Athanasios, an ECE engineer currently pursuing my thesis at the Technical University of Crete. I have a passion for technology, particularly in the field of embedded systems and robotics.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my main hobbies is mountain activities and hiking, which allows me to explore nature and challenge myself physically. I find inspiration and a sense of tranquility in the great outdoors.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current focus is on developing an embedded gimbal system for land-based tracking of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). This project combines my interests in embedded systems, robotics, and tracking technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my academic journey, I have gained a strong foundation in electrical engineering, programming, and problem-solving. I am constantly seeking new opportunities to expand my knowledge and apply it to real-world projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to explore my portfolio and projects to learn more about my work and interests. Thank you for visiting my GitHub Pages site!
