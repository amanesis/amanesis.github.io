      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Manesis Athanasios, an ECE engineer currently pursuing my thesis at the Technical University of Crete.
        I have a passion for technology, particularly in the field of embedded systems and software engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my main hobbies is mountain activities and hiking, which allows me to explore nature and challenge myself physically.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current focus is on developing an embedded gimbal system for land-based tracking of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). 
        This project combines my interests in embedded systems and machine learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my academic journey, I have gained a strong foundation in electrical engineering, programming, and problem-solving.
        I am constantly seeking new opportunities to expand my knowledge and apply it to real-world projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to explore my portfolio and projects to learn more about my work and interests. 
        Thank you for visiting my page!
